## Secure Anonymous Messaging System

### Introduction
This project is a privacy-first, secure, and anonymous messaging system built with React (Vite) for the frontend and Node.js (Express) for the backend. It allows users to send encrypted text messages and files without requiring phone numbers, email addresses, or user registration. Communication is facilitated through unique public/private key pairs that serve as access codes.

This project is ideal for building secure communication tools for whistleblowers, darknet messaging portals, or anyone prioritizing privacy.

### Features
* No Identity Required: No signup, login, phone, or email â€” communication is enabled solely through public/private key pairs.

* Anonymous Inbox & Sent Box: Separate views for received and sent messages with a clean, intuitive interface.

* File Attachment Support: Securely send and receive files alongside messages.

* Key-Based Message Access: Messages are decrypted only with valid private keys.

* Auto-Refresh Inbox: Automatically updates messages every few seconds.

* Dark Mode UI: A sleek, custom-designed dark theme for all screens.

* Server File Storage: Uploaded files are securely stored in the /uploads folder and available for download.

* Simple JSON Storage: Keys and messages are stored in keys.json and messages.json for simplicity.
